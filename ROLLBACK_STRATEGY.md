# Single Device Login Feature - Rollback Strategy

## Branch Structure

### Main Branch (`main`)
- **Current State**: Clean state without single device login feature
- **Last Commit**: `fcb3cf4` - "feat: Enhance premium blur effects with theme-aware transparency"
- **Purpose**: Stable production-ready code without experimental features

### Feature Branch (`feature/single-device-login`)
- **Current State**: Contains the complete single device login implementation
- **Last Commit**: `61f2348` - "feat: Implement single device login security feature"
- **Purpose**: Isolated development of single device login feature

## Rollback Options

### Option 1: Switch to Main Branch (Current State)
```bash
git checkout main
```
- **Result**: App runs without single device login feature
- **Use Case**: If you want to disable the feature temporarily

### Option 2: Enable Single Device Login Feature
```bash
git checkout feature/single-device-login
```
- **Result**: App runs with full single device login functionality
- **Use Case**: If you want to test or use the feature

### Option 3: Merge Feature to Main (Permanent Integration)
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/single-device-login
git push origin main
```
- **Result**: Single device login becomes part of main codebase
- **Use Case**: When you're satisfied with the feature and want to make it permanent

### Option 4: Complete Rollback (Remove Feature Branch)
```bash
git branch -D feature/single-device-login
git push origin --delete feature/single-device-login
```
- **Result**: Completely removes the single device login feature
- **Use Case**: If you decide not to use this feature at all

## Feature Components

The single device login feature includes:

### Core Files
- `services/sessionService.ts` - Session management service
- `components/SessionManagerTest.tsx` - Development testing component
- `context/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with session management
- `services/userService.ts` - Added session utilities
- `components/Settings.tsx` - Added session testing UI

### Key Features
1. **Unique Session IDs**: Each login creates a unique session identifier
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Firebase listeners detect session conflicts
3. **Automatic Logout**: Previous sessions are terminated when new login occurs
4. **Activity Tracking**: User interactions update session activity
5. **Cross-device Detection**: Works across browsers and devices
6. **Graceful Cleanup**: Proper session termination on logout

## Testing the Feature

### Current Branch Check
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

### Switch to Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout feature/single-device-login
npm run dev
```

### Test Single Device Login
1. Sign in to your account in main browser
2. Open incognito/private window or different browser
3. Sign in with same account
4. Original session should be logged out automatically
5. Check console for session management logs

### Development Tools
- Session Manager Test component (visible in Settings during development)
- Console logging for all session events
- Real-time session data inspection

## Recommendation

**Current Recommendation**: Keep the feature in the separate branch for now
- **Reason**: Allows easy testing without affecting main codebase
- **Next Steps**: Test thoroughly across different devices and browsers
- **Timeline**: Merge to main after 1-2 weeks of successful testing

## Emergency Rollback

If any issues occur while testing:
```bash
git checkout main
npm run dev
```

This immediately disables the single device login feature and returns to stable state.
