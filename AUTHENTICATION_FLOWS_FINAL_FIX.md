# Authentication Flows - Final Fix Complete

## 🎯 Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Authentication flows (sign-up, sign-in, Google Sign-In) were not working due to a typo in `authService.ts`.

**Solution**: Fixed the typo `lessionsUnlocked` → `lessonsUnlocked` in both instances within the user data objects.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Key Fix Applied
- **File**: `d:\Typer\services\authService.ts`
- **Lines**: 62 and 102
- **Change**: `lessionsUnlocked: 5` → `lessonsUnlocked: 5`

### Impact

- Email/Password Sign-Up
- Email/Password Sign-In  
- Google Sign-In (via Firebase Auth)

- ✅ Google Sign-In with redirect flow and scopes
- ✅ Error handling and user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Proper Firebase integration

### 2. Sign-Up Component (`SignUp.tsx`)
- ✅ Form validation (name, email, password)
- ✅ Security features (input sanitization, rate limiting)

### 5. App Integration (`App.tsx`)

## 🔐 Security Features Maintained

- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Rate limiting for auth attempts
- ✅ Secure session storage with encryption
