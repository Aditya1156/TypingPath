# Navigation Memory Fix

## Problem
When users selected a weak topic from the dashboard and practiced it, clicking "Back" would take them to the lessons page instead of returning to the dashboard where they started.

## Root Cause
The `handleBackToMenu` function was hardcoded to always navigate back to the 'lessons' view, regardless of where the user came from.

## Solution
Added a `previousView` state to track where the user was before navigating to a test or guide, and updated the navigation logic to return to the correct previous view.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Previous View State
```tsx
const [previousView, setPreviousView] = useState<'lessons' | 'test' | 'guide' | 'dashboard'>('lessons');
```

### 2. Updated Navigation Functions
All functions that navigate to a test or guide now track the previous view:

- `handleSelectLesson()` - Sets previous view before going to guide/test
- `handleSelectDrill()` - Sets previous view before going to test  
- `handleSelectRandom()` - Sets previous view before going to test
- `handlePracticeAiDrill()` - Sets previous view before going to test
- `handleGenerateAiDrill()` - Sets previous view before going to test
- `handleNavigate()` - Sets previous view for manual navigation

### 3. Updated Back Navigation
```tsx
const handleBackToMenu = useCallback(() => {
  saveScrollPosition(view);
  setView(previousView); // Now goes back to where user came from
  setCurrentLesson(null);
  resetAiState();
}, [view, previousView, saveScrollPosition]);
```

### 4. Updated UI Labels
- Back buttons now show contextual text: "Back to Dashboard" vs "Back to Lessons"
- Breadcrumbs reflect the correct navigation path
- Tooltips are contextually accurate

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. User is in Dashboard
2. User clicks weak topic → goes to typing test
3. User clicks "Back to Lessons" → ends up in Lessons (❌ wrong!)
4. User has to navigate back to Dashboard manually

### After  
1. User is in Dashboard
2. User clicks weak topic → goes to typing test
3. User clicks "Back to Dashboard" → returns to Dashboard (✅ correct!)
4. Scroll position is preserved, user sees exactly where they left off

## Benefits
- ✅ **Intuitive Navigation**: Users return to where they came from
- ✅ **Preserved Context**: Scroll position and dashboard state maintained  
- ✅ **Better UX**: No need to re-navigate to dashboard after practicing
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Works for all entry points (lessons, dashboard, etc.)
- ✅ **Smart Labels**: UI text adapts to show correct destination

## Technical Details
- Uses React state to track navigation history
- Preserves scroll positions for smooth user experience
- Updates button labels and breadcrumbs dynamically
- Compatible with ESC key navigation
- Works with all practice modes (lessons, random, AI drills, weak spots)

## Testing Scenarios
1. ✅ Dashboard → Weak Topic → Back = Returns to Dashboard
2. ✅ Lessons → Lesson → Back = Returns to Lessons  
3. ✅ Lessons → Random → Back = Returns to Lessons
4. ✅ Dashboard → AI Drill → Back = Returns to Dashboard
5. ✅ Scroll position preserved in all scenarios
