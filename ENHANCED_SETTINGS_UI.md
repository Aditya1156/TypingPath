#### 1. Settings Header
- **Before:** Just "Settings" title
- **After:** 
  - Title: "Settings" 
  - Subtitle: "Customize your typing experience"

#### 2. Theme Selection
- **Before:** Simple theme names (dark, light, hacker, etc.)
- **After:** 
  - Helper text: "Choose your preferred color scheme"
  - Enhanced theme labels with emojis and descriptions:
    - 🌙 Classic Dark
    - ☀️ Clean Light  
    - 💚 Matrix Style
    - 🌊 Ocean Blue
    - 🌅 Warm Sunset
    - 🌲 Nature Green

#### 3. Caret Style

#### 4. Sound Effects
- **Before:** Just the toggle switch
- **After:**
  - Helper text: "Enable audio feedback while typing"
  - Clear test sound section when enabled

### 🎨 **Visual Improvements**

#### Layout Enhancements
- **Full-width sections:** Each setting uses full available width
- **Better spacing:** Increased padding and margins for readability
- **Grid layout:** Themes arranged in a 2x3 grid for better organization
- **Consistent styling:** All descriptions use same text color and size

#### Theme Button Improvements  
- **Larger buttons:** Increased padding for better touch targets

### 🧠 **User Experience Benefits**

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### Code Organization
- **Extracted theme function:** `getThemeDescription()` for cleaner code

#### Theme Descriptions Map
```tsx
const getThemeDescription = (theme: Theme) => {
  switch (theme) {
    case 'dark': return '🌙 Classic Dark';
    case 'light': return '☀️ Clean Light';
    case 'hacker': return '💚 Matrix Style';
    case 'ocean': return '🌊 Ocean Blue';
    case 'sunset': return '🌅 Warm Sunset';

    default: return theme;
  }
};
```

### ✅ **Quality Assurance**
