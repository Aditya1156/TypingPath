### 🔍 **What You See on GitHub:**
If you're still seeing exposed keys on GitHub, you might be:
1. **Looking at an old commit** - Check you're viewing the latest commit
2. **Viewing a legacy branch** - Make sure you're on `main` or `develop` 
3. **Seeing cached content** - GitHub sometimes caches file views

### 🚀 **Verification Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Aditya1156/TypeForge
2. Ensure you're on **main** branch (not develop or others)
3. Open `firebaseConfig.ts`
4. You should see: `apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
5. NOT: `apiKey: "AIzaSyAO9k4a2fJTXFRYoOotqhL2CdgiYiuk0-g"`

### 🔒 **Security Measures Implemented:**
1. **Environment Variables**: All API keys moved to env vars
2. **Validation**: App checks for missing env vars on startup
3. **Documentation**: Complete setup guides created
4. **Git Ignore**: .env.local properly ignored
5. **Deployment Ready**: Vercel setup instructions provided
